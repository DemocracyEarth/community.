## Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct is based on [Code for America's](https://github.com/codeforamerica/codeofconduct/blob/master/README.md) Code of Conduct and has been adapted by the Democracy Earth Foundation to serve our community's purpose. 

* * * 

 

The Democracy Earth Foundation community expects that Democracy Earth network activities, events, and digital forums:

1. Are a safe and respectful environment for all participants.

2. Are a place where people are free to fully express their identities.

3. Presume the value of others. Everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions have value.

4. Don’t assume everyone has the same context, and encourage questions.

5. Find a way for people to be productive with their skills (technical and not) and energy. Use language such as “yes/and”, not “no/but.”

6. Encourage members and participants to listen as much as they speak.

7. Only build tools that are open and free technology for public use - open source.

8. Prioritize access for and input from those who are traditionally excluded from the civic process.

9. Work to ensure that the community is well-represented in the planning, design, and implementation of our technologies. This includes encouraging participation from women, minorities, and traditionally marginalized groups. 

10. Actively involve community groups and those with subject matter expertise in the decision-making process.

11. Ensure that the relationships and conversations between community members, the local government staff and community partners remain respectful, participatory, and productive.

12. Provide an environment where people are free from discrimination or harassment.

Democracy Earth Foundation reserves the right to ask anyone in violation of these policies not to participate in Democracy Earth Foundation network activities, events, and digital forums.

## Anti-Harassment Policy

This anti-harassment policy is based on <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy">the example policy</a> from the Geek Feminism wiki, created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers, the Ohio LinuxFest anti-harassment policy written by Esther Filderman and Beth Lynn Eicher, and the Con Anti-Harassment Project. Mary Gardiner, Valerie Aurora, Sarah Smith, and Donna Benjamin generalized the policies and added supporting material. Many members of LinuxChix, Geek Feminism and other groups contributed to this work. Democracy Earth Foundation has adapted it to serve our community's purpose. 

* * * 



All Democracy Earth Foundation network activities, events (whether sponsored by DEF or a partner orgnaization), and digital forums and their staff, presenters, and participants are held to an anti-harassment policy, included below.

**In addition to governing our own events by this policy, Democracy Earth Foundation will only lend our resources - whether through DEF brand identity, funding or other means - to  groups that offer an anti-harassment policy to their attendees. For information on how to offer an anti-harassment policy to your group, <a href="https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/ambassadors/blob/master/Partner-Anti-Harassment-Policy.md">see this guide"</a>.**


## Our Pledge
Democracy Earth Foundation is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of staff, presenters, and participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any Democracy Earth event or network activity, including talks, email communications and social messaging. Anyone in violation of these policies may be expelled from Democracy Earth Ambassador network activities, events, and digital forums, at the discretion of a DEF core team member.

Harassment includes but is not limited to: offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; unwelcome sexual attention; unwarranted exclusion; and patronizing language or action.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from all Democracy Earth Foundaton and Ambassador Program network activities, events, and digital forums. 

**If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please take the following steps:** 

1. contact a member of the Democracy Earth Foundation core team immediately to report your concern
2. document your concerns in full in an email to Paula Berman (Paula@Democracy.Earth) 
3. in the case of a DEF sponsored event or forum we will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement as needed, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.
4. if you cannot reach a DEF event organizer or forum administrator and/or it is an emergency, please call 911 and/or remove yourself from the situation. 

You can also contact DEF about harassment at hello@democracy.earth and feel free to use the email template below. 

The Democracy Earth team acknowledges that we are not always in a position to evaluate a given situation due to the number of geographically dispered events and the fact that our team is not always present. However, it is our hope and intention in providing these guidelines to establish a community that adheres to DEF's core values and provides an environment that is welcoming and supportive to all.

We value your particpation in DEF events and forums and hope that by communicating these expectations widely we can all enjoy a harassment-free environment.
